# Python Challenge
This project is intended to analyze financial and election data.

## Code Source
I used previous classwork, Stack Overflow, and ChatGPT for the code in both parts of this project. I worked on this challenge with my classmate Matthew Guy. We collaborated on both parts of the assignment, and it was very helpful to work through this with someone else, as well as explain my code out loud to someone.
