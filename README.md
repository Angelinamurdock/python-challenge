# Python Financial and Election Analysis
**Creator**: Angelina Murdock  
**Date**: January 2025

## Overview
This project demonstrates the use of Python scripting to perform data analysis on two real-world datasets: financial records and election results. The goal is to automate the extraction of key metrics from large CSV files using core Python programming skills such as file handling, lists, loops, and conditional logic.

The project is split into two challenges:
- **PyBank:** Analyze a company's financial performance over a given time period
- **PyPoll**: Evaluate election results and determine the winning candidate
